# Underwater-Image-Enchancement-Using-Sharpening-Methods
Underwater image enhancement using image sharpening methods on google colab. The methods that has been used are Kernel Sharpening, Gaussian Blur Unsharp masking and Suming images. Sharpening helps to see missing details in underwater images. Underwater Image Enhancement Benchmark (UIEB) including 950 real-world underwater images has been used in this project.
